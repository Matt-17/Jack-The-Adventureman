# Jack - The Adventureman
This was my end of school project in Turbo Pascal for computer science in 2003. So don't blame me ;)
It's developed in Turbo Pascal and runs in DOSBox (with increased cycles though). 

Do whatever you want with this :)

If you want an overview and some real screenshots, please read Einleitung.pdf.
